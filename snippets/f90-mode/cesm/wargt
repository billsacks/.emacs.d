# This results in a completed line like:
#     forc_rain = w%wateratm2lnd_inst%forc_rain_col(begc:endc), &
#
# The "w%" assumes that we have done an associate like:
#     associate(w => water_inst%bulk_and_tracers(i))
#
# The inclusion of "_" before patch/col in the choice list, rather than
# having it appear immediately following the $1, improves
# auto-completion behavior (with both auto-complete and company modes),
# by not presenting an option that looks like VARNAME_.
#
# SEE ALSO: wargb: wargt and wargb should remain nearly identical
