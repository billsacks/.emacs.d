# This results in a completed line like:
#     forc_rain = b_wateratm2lnd_inst%forc_rain_col(begc:endc), &
#
# The "b_wateratm2lnd_inst%" assumes that we have done an associate like:
#     associate(b_wateratm2lnd_inst => water_inst%wateratm2lndbulk_inst
# (Its main purpose is to give the same number of characters as the
# tracer version, which has w%wateratm2lnd_inst.)
#
# The inclusion of "_" before patch/col in the choice list, rather than
# having it appear immediately following the $1, improves
# auto-completion behavior (with both auto-complete and company modes),
# by not presenting an option that looks like VARNAME_.
#
# SEE ALSO: wargt: wargb and wargt should remain nearly identical
