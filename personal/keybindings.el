;; General keybinding notes:
;;
;; I'm using A-* keybindings (where I have bound the option key to A) for:
;; - editing (inserting unicode characters, the sort of things that ctrl and meta are
;;   often used for, etc.)
;; - things that I might want to do multiple times in succession (because it's more
;;   convenient to do that with a modifier key than with a prefix key)
;;
;; I'm using H-* keybindings (where I have bound the home and ESC keys to H) for commands
;; where I want a simple, one-key binding (grep, switching frames, etc.).
;;
;; I'm also defining some C-x * keybindings (particularly things that are similar to other
;; C-x keybindings) as well as C-c * keybindings (especially for things that feel like
;; "editing").
;;
;; I also have some super (s-*) keybindings. These are generally used to group together
;; similar commands. For example, s-w groups together some window-related commands.
;;
;; In the future I could see adding C-return or M-return as a prefix for some commands
;; (though note that these conflict with default key bindings in org mode).

(require 'macros)

;; With command acting as meta, escape is more useful as hyper rather than meta. But keep
;; ability to get escape with shift-escape if I really need it. Also bind "home" and "end"
;; to modifiers because home and end aren't very useful in emacs. Note that esc and home
;; are symmetrical, which is why I have bound them both to hyper. It would probably be
;; okay to just have one hyper, but I think there is more benefit than harm in assigning
;; both of these keys to hyper.
;;
;; Note about my choice of having hyper be the symmetrical one rather than super: With
;; super being mainly used for things where I'll hit a few keys in a row, I've found it
;; doesn't feel intuitive to have it on both sides of the keyboard: my brain thinks about
;; the two or three letters I want to type for the command, and so then it isn't automatic
;; which side to use for the super key. So I'm putting hyper in the place that is slightly
;; harder to reach but symmetrical, and super in the place that is slightly easier to
;; reach and asymmetrical.
